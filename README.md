# Astro theme "flashy"

This is a simple and minimalistic astro theme taking advantage of xelemeent for smooth and seamless page transitions.

## Nav
You can chage your nav pages by:
- Adding a new page in `./src/pages`
- Changing the relevant entry in `./src/config.ts`
	- Title: What the user sees
	- URL: Where the nav should point to
	- Color: What color should the nav be in that page
	- Icon: What icon should the spinner show

## Blog
You can add a blog entry by creating a new markdown file in `./src/blog`. It should follow the naming `<number>-<name>.md`, where a higer number should appear first.
